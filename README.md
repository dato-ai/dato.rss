**Search Engine:** Quickly search through the millions of available RSS feeds.

**RESTful API:** Turns feed data into an awesome API. The API simplifies how you handle RSS, Atom, or JSON feeds. You can add and keep track of your favourite feed data with a simple, fast and clean REST API. All entries are enriched by Machine Learning and Semantic engines.

## Search

Search is just implemented with Full Text Search Postgres feature.

I used the *pg_search Gem*, which can be used in two ways:

**Multi Search:** Search across multiple models and return a single array of results. Imagine having three models: Product, Brand, and Review. Using Multi Search we could search across all of them at the same time, seeing a single set of search results. This would be perfect for adding federated search functionality to your app.

**Search Scope:** Search within a single model, but with greater flexibility.

```sql
    execute <<-SQL
      ALTER TABLE entries
      ADD COLUMN searchable tsvector GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
        setweight(to_tsvector('simple', coalesce(title, '')), 'A') ||
        setweight(to_tsvector('simple', coalesce(body,'')), 'B') ||
        setweight(to_tsvector('simple', coalesce(url,'')), 'C')
      ) STORED;
    SQL
```


## Feed Rank

Feed Ranking is provided by [openrank](https://openrank.io) a free root domain authority metric based on the common search pagerank dataset. The value is normilized by 

```ruby
((Math.log10(domain_rank) / Math.log10(100)) * 100).round
```

## Machine Learning

Machine Learning is provided by [dandelion API](https://dandelion.eu) Semantic Text Analytics as a service, from text to actionable data. Extract meaning from unstructured text and put it in context with a simple API.

# Add Feed

You can add as many feeds as you want for the automatic crawler to handle.

https://datorss.com/feeds/new

## Wiki

All API documentation is in the Wiki section. Feel free to make it better, of course.

https://github.com/dato-ai/dato.rss/wiki

To use some features such as adding a new feed you need a token with **write** permission. Currently only I can enable it. In case contact me
